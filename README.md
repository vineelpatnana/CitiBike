# CitiBike
I have used citibike NYC data (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) to perform analysis and draw inferences to understand the usage patterns and trends among different routes and users.
The data was scraped using beautiful soup package and preprocessign using Pandas and then stored in a relational database schema using mysql.
Used an API from google maps to plot the lattitude and longitude on google maps on a Jupyter notebook
I did analysis like what are the busy days, the busy hours, what percentage of subscribers vs one time users use the service, the most frequent routes shown by gmaps etc
